# A-Algorithm-Implementation-in-Clisp
The Theoretical Scent Diffuser, implemented in Common Lisp, utilizes the A* algorithm to navigate scent classification. This concise yet powerful code explores scent relationships, costs, and heuristic values through hierarchical tree traversal. Join us as we unravel the mysteries of scent perception with A* at the helm.
